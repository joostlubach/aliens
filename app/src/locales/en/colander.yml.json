{"colander":{"paragraphs":["WE HAVE FORGOTTEN TWO COLANDERS WHEN WE VISITED LAST. [TOO BAD PEANUTBUTTER] LIKE WE ALWAYS SAY ON OUR PLANET. YOU PROBABLY HAVE ANOTHER EXPRESSION. THESE ARE CEREMONIAL COLANDERS. THEY ARE FORGED BY KING [...] TO PROTECT HIS PRIVATE PARTS AND THOSE OF ALL HIS DESCENDANTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. WE NEED TO TEST WHETHER THEY STILL WORK. A PROPER COLANDER MAKES GOOD CONTACT WITH THE HEAD â€“ WHERE OF COURSE THE PRIVATE PARTS ARE. A PROPERLY CONNECTED COLANDER CONDUCTS WELL. PLEASE GO AND TEST THEM. PERHAPS YOU NEED TO RECRUIT OTHER HUMAN CREATURES TO ASSIST."]}}
